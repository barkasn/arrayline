Software Requirements
---------------------

Arrayline requires:
	* A UNIX-like operating system (e.g. Linux or MacOS X)
	* An Apache instalation (version 2 or later recommended)
	* PHP5 installed and configured to process PHP files
	* A mysql database
	* R with Bioconductor (for Affymetrix modules)

Individual modules may have further requirements

Installation Guidelines for Ubuntu systems
------------------------------------------

Ubuntu User Home Folder installation

The following commands are provided as a guideline only, the commands
required will vary from system to system. You should review each command
and execute it manually.


A. Required Software Installation

	1. Install apache2
		$ sudo apt-get install apache2
	
	2. Install mysql
		$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server

	3. Install phpMyAdmin (not required but highly recommended)
		$ sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin

B. Apache configuration

	1. Enable Apache User directories
		
	Assuming you want to run apache in a user directory and not in the main
	httpd folder you need to enable the user directories module:

		$ sudo ap2enmod userdir

	In Ubuntu, user directories are by default not processing php files
	To enable php processing edit the php4 apache configuration file php5.conf
	The file contains instructions in the form of comments to enable phpi
	comment out the appropriate lines as per instruction in the file

		$ gedit /etc/apache2/mods-available/php5.conf


	Allow large file uploads in php configuration. Edit 
	/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini and increase both the post form limit
	and the maximum file size. Specifically set both post_max_size
	and upload_max_filesize to '1G' - one gigabyte. Reboot apache.

C. R with Bioconductor
	
	Install R and a _site-wide_ installation of the bioconductor packages. 
	From the command prompt run:
		
		$ sudo apt-get install libcurl3-dev
		$ sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
		$ sudo R
		> source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
		> biocLite()

D. Get arrayline
	
	1. Create a public directory on your (or preferably a dedicated users) 
		home folder and make it accessible to the webserver ( you are
		also making it accessible to every other user on the system)

		$ cd ~/..
		$ chmod 755 `whoami`
		$ cd ~
		$ mkdir public_html
		$ chmod 755 public_html
		$ cd public_html
		$ svn co https://arrayline.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/arrayline/trunk/public_html arrayline 

	2. Export a copy of the trunk to get access to the dbconfig and database files
		
		$ cd ~
		$ mkdir tmp
		$ cd tmp
		$ svn export https://arrayline.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/arrayline/trunk/ arrayline

	3. copy the dbconfig.php to your home directory (were arrayline will 
		look for it if placed in ~/public_html/arrayline
		(you can change this location by editing arrayline/system/configuration.php)

		$ cp arrayline/trunk/dbconfig.php ~/dbconfig.php

	4. Edit dbconfig.php to set the details of your database
		$ gedit ~/dbconfig.php
	
	5. Edit the configuration file arrayline/system/configuration.php and set the basepath
		to the root of the arrayline installation

		$ gedit ~/public_html/arrayline/system/configuration.php

	6. Make the job and dataset directories world writable (so that the server can write to them)

		$ cd ~/public_html/arrayline
		$ chmod 0777 jobs
		$ chmod 0777 datastore

	7. Use phpmyadmin to import database.sql into your server

	8. Visit http://localhost/~username/arrayline on your browser and login

	9. Change the default password
