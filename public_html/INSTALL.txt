Installation
------------

Ubuntu User Home Folder installation

1. Install apache2
	sudo apt-get install apache2
	
2. Install mysql
	sudo apt-get install mysql-server

3. Install phpMyAdmin (recommended for managing db)
	sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin

4. Create a database on your mysql server and a user with access to that database

5. Enable Apache User directories

	sudo ap2enmod userdir
	# Edit php5 conf, comment out line as per instruction in the file
	# to allow php to execute in the userdirs
	gedit /etc/apache2/mods-available/php5.conf


6. Download the latest copy of arrayline from sourceforge
	If you want to install arrayline on a user directory (recommended for development)
	Create a public directory on you folder:

	cd ~
	cd ..
	# Makes your directory readable by the server (but also by all other users)
	# It might be possible to use mode 744 to make directory accessible but not listable
	chmod 755 `whoami`
	cd ~
	mkdir public_html
	chmod 755 public_html
	cd public_html
	# This will create a new directory called arrayline in public_html
	svn co https://arrayline.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/arrayline/trunk/public_html arrayline 

	cd ~
	mkdir tmp
	cd tmp
	# export a copy of the trunk to get access to the dbconfig and database files
	svn export https://arrayline.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/arrayline/trunk/ arrayline
	#copy the db config to your home dir (were arrayline will look for it if placed in
	# ~/public_html/arrayline
	# see arrayline/system/configuration.php for details
	cp arrayline/trunk/dbconfig.php ~/dbconfig.php
	#edit dbconfig and set the details of your database
	# set server to localhost not 127.0.0.1 (it uses a local socket instead to tcp/ip and is faster)
	gedit ~/dbconfig.php
	
	#edit the configuration file arrayline/system/configuration.php and set the basepath
	# you should not need to change anything else
	# leave debug on
	gedit ~/public_html/arrayline/system/configuration.php

	# make the job and dataset directories world writable (so that the server can write to them)
	cd ~/public_html/arrayline
	chmod 0777 jobs
	chmod 0777 datastore

7. Use phpmyadmin to import database.sql into your server

8. Visit http://localhost/~username/arrayline on your browser and login
